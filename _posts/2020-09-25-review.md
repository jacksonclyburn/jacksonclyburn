Jackson's Review: A Data History of Popular Hip Hop
---

The project _A Data History of Popular Hip Hop_, Is a project created by **StoryBench** to portray the increasing influence hip hop has in our culture as it has recently become the most popular genre in America. It uses illustrations such as maps, graphs, and word counts to help explain how hip hop has had a bigger impact on American culture than people would expect. Hip Hop has been notorious for coming out of certain cities for many years. Cities such as Atlanta, Compton, Brooklyn, and Chicago. Recently, due to the spread and opportunity of hip hop, there have been much more artists coming from a wider range of locations. Not only has the location grown in American culture, but also the language. The words we hear in these songs impacts our daily speech more than we know. The influence hip hop has on our culture is greater than what we know. This **Storybench** project has helped prove it. 

**StoryBench** was created by [Northeastern University’s Media Innovation Graduate Program](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-arts-in-journalism-media-innovation-track-5228/) in 2014. It was made to help “demystify the tools, methods and technology of digital storytelling, both inside and outside of journalism.”(Storybench).

 One thing that I enjoyed is how they provided a link to the [“Billboard Hot Rap Songs Category”](https://www.billboard.com/charts/rap-song). **StoryBench**  ended up using that link to help create their dataset in order to obtain the proper lyrics for each song they used. They also provided a link that explains the process of how they got the lyrics into the database more in depth. This link was actually really helpful because I was a little confused when I read the broader description of their database plan on the main page. One of the more appealing things on this digital humanities project is the map right in the middle of the page. The section is called _"How did Hip-Hop spread geographically"_, It includes a map that tries to show how rappers have previously started coming from more and more different areas across the world. What the map failed to include was a legend and/or a key. Even though there’s only one color used and the description above the map is all you need to know, it would still be helpful to use. Also, you aren’t able to do anything with the dots on the map which is actually disappointing. It doesn’t show anything, such as who’s from each location of the dot. It’s basically just dots on a map. There are dots all the way in [Kyrgyzstan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyrgyzstan), I want to know who's from Kyrgyzstan! Granted, I can just look it up, but it would be much more efficient to have that included on the map.

**StoryBench** used multiple technologies in order to complete this project. The first couple are [Tidytextmining](https://www.tidytextmining.com) and a familiar face, [Github](https://github.com/afran14/hiphop-text-analysis). They used both _GitHub_ and _tidytextmining_ to break down each text into “tokens’ in order to properly place them into a dataset. **Storybench**  also [“scraped”](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/web-scraping-attack/) [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com) in order to get lyrics for each entry.
