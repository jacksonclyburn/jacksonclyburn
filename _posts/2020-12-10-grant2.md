title: Grant Process Part 2
---



Hello! I’m back again with my second blog about how my grant proposal is going. I know I said that my grant proposal was going well in the first blog, but it’s a little different now.

The **[Grant Narrative](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/grant-proposals-or-give-me-the-money/)** really put a bump in my road to completing this proposal. It was more difficult than any other writing I’ve written for my grant proposal. For the grant narrative I wanted to talk about how other projects helped influence mine. That’s not a very productive narrative though. I needed to talk about primarily only my project and how it’s different from any other. I know how my project was unique, but I felt like I was starting to repeat facts, points, and reasons by the time I had to write my narrative. So I had to take more time to get creative and bring in different points. That’s how it got difficult.

Another thing that stumped me was my budget and finding a platform to perform my proposal on. The only reason why the budget was a little tough was the fact that I didn’t need much money. But I felt like I needed more than what my sum was. My proposal is a completely virtual project. It includes studying instagram accounts, which is free. So I didn’t need much at all which frustrated me. 

The same thing happened for finding something to complete my project on. We need something such as **[storymaps](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-story-maps/)** to do our proposal on. Once again, all I needed was a data chart to record my data on. But I overcomplicated it and doubted the fact that I didn’t need much. I totally made this project harder on myself the past two weeks.

As I finish out my project I feel the relief coming. I am very excited to complete this project. It’s been a lot over the past month. It’s all been foreign to me and the rest of my classmates which makes it that much harder. Everytime we had to write something new for the proposal I started off so confused and worried because I didn’t know what was truly expected. I do have to admit that I was saved by Dr. Stover’s samples though. 

As I conclude my blog post, my grant proposal, and my Digital Humanities class (sighs), I think about how far I’ve come to even be comfortable to make a grant proposal. I think about the first week of class when I was so confused as to what Digital Humanities even means. I remember the struggle and stress of making my first blog post. I surely have came far. 

It’s been a whole new learning experience this semester in my Digital Humanities class. I definitely learned the most from creating a grant proposal of my own. I give much respect to people that actually build and follow through with their proposals. Although I give them a lot of respect, grant proposals and digital humanities is not my forte. The process of creating a grant proposal has opened up a whole new door for my writing skills. It even altered my understanding of Digital Humanities before we started the proposal project. Writing this proposal ultimately helped me understand the importance and complexity of creating a Digital Humanities project. It also show me the precision and competition side of digital humanities to make sure your proposal is unique and original. 

Overall, I enjoyed this project and be excited for me because I will complete the remainder of this project very soon!
