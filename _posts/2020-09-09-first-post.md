Hello, my name is Jackson Clyburn and I am currently a student at [Christopher Newport Univeristy] (https://cnu.edu), in Newport News Va. I am a sophomore working on my sociology degree. From there I plan to get my masters degree to become a forensic investigator. 

Sociology has always interested me. From the way we think and or function in different scenarios to how we act in our society has always been exciting to learn. It’s also fun because it always applies to me and you (every human) because we’re all people in the same society.

I’ve grown up working with kids because my parents were always fostering(link). So I got to meet many different kids from many different living conditions. That always has inspired me to study a major that involves working with others. Our family also ended up adopting two girls which makes us a huge family of nine, three girls, four boys, two parents.

Outside of the school setting, I love to dance(link to instagram). It’s something that I’ve always been good at. I recently started taking it more seriously and really began practicing more often. I also run track here at Christopher Newport University. I am a sprinter, so that means I ran the 100m, 200m, and 400m. Last year I made it to the CAC Track and Field Championships(link)! Unfortunately, I got last place, but I was very excited to have made it to the championships in the first place. That’s something that many other people cannot say they have done. 

A big dream… actually, goal that I have is becoming a popular public figure for this world. Someone that people can look up to and follow. I want to change people by entertaining them. Bringing happiness out of people has always been a passion of mine.
