Hello, my name is Jackson Clyburn and I am currently a student at [Christopher Newport Univeristy](https://cnu.edu), in Newport News Va. I am a sophomore working on my sociology degree as well as a minor in writing. From there I plan to get my masters degree to become a forensic investigator. 

Sociology has always interested me. From the way we think and or function in different scenarios to how we act in our society has always been exciting to learn. It’s also fun because it always applies to me, you, and every other human because we’re all people living in the same society.

I’ve grown up working with kids because my parents were always [fostering](http://www.adopt.org/what-foster-care). So I got to meet many different kids from many different living conditions. That inspired me to study a major that involves working with others. Our family also ended up adopting two girls which makes us a huge family of nine, three girls, four boys, two parents.

Outside of the school setting, I love to dance. [Check out my instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/__iamjae_/). It’s something that I’ve always been good at. I recently started taking it more seriously and really began practicing more often. I also run track here at Christopher Newport University. I am a sprinter, so that means I ran the 100m, 200m, and 400m. Last year I made it to the [Indoor CAC Track and Field Championships](https://www.cacsports.com/tournaments/Indtrack/2019-20/index)! Unfortunately, I got last place and Covid 19 ruined our chance of an outdoor season. But I was very excited to have made it to the indoor championships in the first place. That’s something that many other people cannot say they have done. 

I love music as well. I am a huge fan of Rnb and throwback music. My favorite artist is actually a rapper by the name of [Lil Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Wayne). I could seriously listen to him all day! I've been listening to him since I was young. My parents rarely let me listen to rap when I was younger so I could only listen to him when they weren't around me. I grew up wanting to be just like him. He has inspired me so much. I am also a huge fan of Usher, Alicia Keys, and Chris Brown. That's honestly the only music I need. I would be fine with only listening to those four listed artists. 

A big dream… actually, a _goal_ that I have is becoming a popular public figure for this world. Someone that people can look up to and follow. I want to change people by entertaining them. Bringing happiness out of people has always been a passion of mine.
